>Hey there! I am Tarikus252, and imagine a situation, when your friend gave you an txt/word or other text document, and you need to copy all text from there to some other place, but you need lines to be separately, copying one after enother.

Thatâ€™s where copytxt app is helping. You have to just open text file, and press **CTRL+V** to paste text when you want and move to next line, and copy it.
